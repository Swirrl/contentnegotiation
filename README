Ruby on Rails Linked Data content negotiation skeleton code.
============================================================

This is a complete (though very simple!) Ruby on Rails application (version 2.3.2). The only non-standard files are the following:

- app/controllers/resources_controller.rb - This is the file that actually does the content negotiation, using the standard Rails 'respond_to' method.    
- config/environment.rb - includes the definition of the application/rdf+xml MIME type and maps it to the .rdf extension.
- config/routes.rb - maps URLs of the form <domain>/resources/<id> to the 'show' action of 'resources_controller'
- app/views/resources/show.erb - to generate the HTML representation of a resource (dummy code only)
- app/views/resources/show.rxml - to generate the RDF representaiton of a resource (dummy code only)


This example assumes the following approach to URIs:

http://<my domain>/resources/<resource_name>   - URI for the resource
http://<my domain>/resources/<resource_name>.html - HTML description of the resource
http://<my domain>/resources/<resource_name>.rdf - RDF description of the resource


To run the application you will need to set up an empty MySQL database called 'conneg_development' with user 'root' and password 'admin'.

To check if it is working: 
--------------------------
1. run the app in development mode 
2. In your browser, enter the url http://localhost:3000/resources/test1
3. You should be redirected to http://localhost:3000/resources/test1.html and see the text "HTML description of the resource here."
4. In your browser, enter the url http://localhost:3000/resources/test1.rdf - you should see some valid RDF
5. From the command line (on Unix like systems) enter:
          curl -v -H "Accept: application/rdf+xml" http://localhost:3000/resources/test1
You should get a response like this:

> GET /resources/test1 HTTP/1.1
> User-Agent: curl/7.16.3 (powerpc-apple-darwin9.0) libcurl/7.16.3 OpenSSL/0.9.7l zlib/1.2.3
> Host: localhost:3000
